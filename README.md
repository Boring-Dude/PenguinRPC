# üêß Penguin Discord RPC
**Rich Discord presence for VS Code** ‚Äì show what you‚Äôre hacking on without exposing sensitive paths.

---

## Features
- **Language-specific icons** ‚Äì 100+ mapped out of the box
- **Privacy-first** ‚Äì only the language ID, line number and error count leave your machine
- **Local socket** ‚Äì trusted apps on your computer can update presence (token-authenticated + HMAC)
- **Zero config** ‚Äì works immediately after install; optionally tweak everything

---

## Install
1. Grab the extension from the marketplace ‚ûú `Penguin Discord RPC`
2. Reload VS Code
3. Open Discord ‚Äì your status should now show *‚ÄúEditing TypeScript‚Äù*

## Configuration
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `discordRpc.clientId` | `1428089034458009770` | Discord application ID (own app = upload your icons) |
| `discordRpc.showLineAndErrors` | `true` | Display current line & error count |
| `discordRpc.socketPath` | *(auto)* | Override local socket location (advanced) |

---

## Language Icons
Icons are **asset keys** uploaded to your Discord application.
We ship a base set; add more by:

1. Go to [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) ‚Üí *Rich Presence ‚Üí Art Assets*
2. Drag the wanted PNG from `assets/icons` and set **Key** = file name (without `.png`)
3. Restart VS Code ‚Äì done!

Missing one? PR the mapping in `src/icon-loader.ts`.

---

## Security Model
- Socket created inside VS Code‚Äôs private storage directory (`700` permissions)
- Every message is HMAC-SHA-256 signed with a per-install token stored in secret state
- Max 4 concurrent connections, 64 kB message limit, automatic stale-socket cleanup

## Commands

## Troubleshooting
